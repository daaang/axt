Axt
===

Automation tools for taxes in the United States.

Currently in Planning
---------------------

I have basically no idea how I want this to work yet. I'm in the very
beginning phases of this project.

Will this be ready in time to do my taxes for 2016?
---------------------------------------------------

Absolutely not. Definitely do not count on this ever being done.

Axt is a GPLv3 project. If you don't know what it means, it means that
you can copy, distribute, and modify anything and everything here, but
you have to preserve headers and licensing. Pretty standard stuff.

What sets this license apart from others is that you *must* release your
software under the GPLv3 if it contains modified versions of this code
or if it includes this code (e.g. via compilation).
